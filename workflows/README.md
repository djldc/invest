# Workflows

Markdown SOPs defining objectives, inputs, steps, and edge cases (WAT framework Layer 1).

## Template
Each workflow file should cover:
1. **Objective** — what this accomplishes
2. **Inputs** — what's needed before starting
3. **Steps** — which tools to run, in what order
4. **Expected outputs** — what success looks like
5. **Edge cases** — known failure modes and how to handle them

## Naming convention
`verb_noun.md`
Examples: `export_user_report.md`, `send_newsletter.md`, `update_premium_features.md`

## Rule
Do not create or overwrite workflow files without explicit instruction.
